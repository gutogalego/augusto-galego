## Why does a DNS exist?

Think of a phonebook. You can't possible be expected to memorize every number you intend on calling. Similarly, every server has it's own "number", the IP address. For example **192.133.76.0**. But again, we won't really remember this number. Remembering "Twitter.com" is easier.

The DNS is the internet's phonebook.

## What exactly is "The DNS"?

DNS stands for Domain name system. And it is a hierarchical infrastructure composed of multiple name servers. There are four types of servers in the hierarchy:

1. **DNS Resolver:** The resolver is what initiates the query, and forwards the request to other DNS Name servers. Sometimes they can also cache.  
2. **Root-level name servers:** Root name servers maintain name server based on top level domains (TLDs) such as .com .io etc. They return a list of servers that hold the IP addesses of the .io domain for example.
3. **TLD name servers**: they hold the IP addresses of authoritative servers of the organization.
4. **Authoritative name servers:** They provide the IP Addresses of the application servers.


## Two types of queries:

There are Iterative and Recursive queries to the DNS. Iterative is usually preferred to reduce query load

1. **Iterative**: The local server requests for the root, TLD, and the authoritative servers for they IP address
2. **Recursive**: The end user requests the local server. The local server forwards the request to other name servers.


## Caching

Caching is used in the browser, the operating systems, the local name server, and on the ISP. They are used to make the user experience faster, and reduce load.![[Screenshot 2023-11-06 at 11.12.20 PM.png]]



## Distribution:

The DNS hierarchy ex extremely distributed. There are 13 logical root name server on the world, and they are managed by 12 different organizations.


## Scalability

There are about 1000 replications of the 13 servers. Those offer additional capacity, and reduced latency.
